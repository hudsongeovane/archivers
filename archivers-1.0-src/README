Introduction
------------

  We examine the problem of maintaining an approximation of the set of
  nondominated points visited during a multiobjective optimization, a
  problem commonly known as archiving. The main scenario considered is
  the restricted case where the archive must be updated online as
  points are generated one by one, and at most a fixed number of
  points are to be stored in the archive at any one time.

  This program implements most of the currently available archiving
  algorithms in a common framework for simplifying their comparison
  and analysis.

Building
------------

The program can be compiled from source by invoking

   make

------------
Usage
------------

The program reads a file containing a sequence of objective
vectors. Each objective vector appears in a different line and the
objectives are columns separated by whitespace. An example of
invocation would be

   archivers -f sequence.txt -t 1 -N 10 

The other options available are given by the output of archivers -h

-t integer : archive type
         0      Unbound Archiver
         1      Dominating Archiver
         2      ePareto Archiver
         3      e-approx Archiver
         4      SPEA2 Archiver
         5      NSGA2 Archiver
         6      Adaptive Grid Archiver (AGA)
         7      Hypervolume Archiver (AA_S)
         8      Multilevel Grid Archiver (MGA)
-f character string : file name of sequence data
-N positive integer : capacity of the archive
-len positive integer : length of the input sequence
-s positive long : random seed
-o character string: output filename for sequence output,
                     otherwise, print only the final result to stdout.
-g positive integer : number of levels of the adaptive grid; 
                      #grid regions=2^(l*k)
-e positive float : epsilon value for epsilon archivers
-v                : print version and copyright information
