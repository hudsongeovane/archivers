This is a repository of experiments within multiobjective problems. Archiving techniques are being implemented and tested.
We are analysing some properties of the archiving techniques.

A first review of theses archivers are provided in http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/IridiaTrSeries/IridiaTr2011-001.pdf

This work extends the one by IRIDIA, and is being made by Universidade Federal do RN - Departamento de Informática e Matemática Aplicada - Brazil
